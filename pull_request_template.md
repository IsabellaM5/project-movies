Our reflections on how this week's project turned out
We did all the blue level requirements. We also did some stretch goals on red and black level.

It was a fun and challenging project! React Router is a great feature, can't wait to deep dive more into React!

One problem that we encountered was when we tried to move the useParams from the components MovieList and MovieDetails to App.js, it made the node_modules crash. We tried to fix it but ended up moving our code to a new repo instead.


Things we'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail
We would've like to hear more about useHistory and its different methods and use cases. We know that our component BackLink isn't working as we would've wanted it (it's not dynamic).
